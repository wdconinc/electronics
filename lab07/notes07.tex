\section{Lab 4: Passive Filters}

\subsection*{General comments}

\begin{itemize}
\item Prefer use of oscilloscope over the use of DVM in preparation of filters: AC signals should typically be viewed on oscilloscope, and RMS can confuse things...
\item For design exercise on band-pass filter, use the highest frequency on the low-pass and lowest frequency on high pass.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Source Impedance Review (30 minutes)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Light-bulbs have about 5\,\Ohm resistance, but under influence of temperature they get a higher resistance of 10\,\Ohm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{High-Pass Filter (1 hour)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Newer boards do not have a transformer, but you can use the built-in signal generator to add a 60\,Hz signal.
\end{itemize}
